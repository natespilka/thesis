This README is still under construction but provides basic information about my thesis and the repo. More to come!

I'm studying the geospatial relationship between [NYC DYCD programs](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dycd/about/about-dycd/about-dycd.page) and local juvenile crime at the block group level. Existing research finds that these programs are associated with a reduction in crime but at the individual level. My project studies a similar question but at the community level of analyses.

- `scripts/wrangling/data_wrangling_v4.R` is the script that cleans and merges ACS, NYC crime, and DYCD data into a single dataset usable for various analyses and visualizations. Other scripts in this folder help with specific dimentions of the project (e.g., crosswalks, initial API/cleaning crime dataset, intial cleaning of ACS data). 

- `output` contains intial/experimental analyses and visualizations. Like the rest of this repo, this will be updated.

Here's some research if you're interested in learning more!
